## What is Conway's Game of Life?

Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The "game" is a simulation of a grid of cells, each of which can be either alive or dead. The cells evolve over generations according to a set of rules based on the state of neighboring cells.
